Run with ./rlg. Program generates a dungeon filled with mosnters and items. The player picks up any items they walk over and places them into their inventory if inventory is not full. The player can equip, drop, expunge, or inspect any item in their inventory. Additionally, an equipped item may be removed and placed back into the inventory. Inventory and equipment can be displayed in a submenu. The player may also look at any visible monster to get its description. When a monster comes in contact with the PC or vice versa, combat takes place. Damage is calculated using the monster's damage dice or the PC's equipment. If a character dies, the attacker moves onto the killed character's position.
